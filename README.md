# 📊 Analytics Warehouse 

This project demonstrates how to design and build a **modern data warehouse** using SQL Server.  
It follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to transform raw ERP and CRM data into **business-ready insights**.

1. **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingested from ERP & CRM CSV files.  
2. **Silver Layer** → Data cleansing, transformation, and standardization.  
3. **Gold Layer** → Star schema with fact and dimension tables for analytics.
